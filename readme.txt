This project provides the files to model the reflected multiple concentric rainbow by the microscale concave interfaces under normal incidence. The ray optics model file is created within COMSOL Multiphysics (version 4.2a). The properties of each ray, including the propagation direction, intensity, phase, wavefront curvature and the escaping point from the tape to air, can be determined using this ray tracing simulation. These above numerical data can be exported to a text file (*.txt). The MATLAB code is employed to load the text file to calculate the far field reflected pattern. Both the COMSOL file and the MATLAB code are contained in this repository. 
  For convenience, it is suggested to save the three file in one folder (including COMSOL file, MATLAB code and the output data file.) One should make sure that all the input parameters in the COMSOL file and MATLAB code are the same, such as light wavelength, diameter of the PS sphere and other geometric parameters.
